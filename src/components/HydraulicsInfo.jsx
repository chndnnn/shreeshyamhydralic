        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600">Basic Principles of Hydraulics</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The fundamental principle behind hydraulics is <strong>Pascal's Law</strong>, which states that when pressure is applied to an enclosed fluid, the pressure is transmitted equally in all directions. This principle is used to design hydraulic systems where pressure is applied to fluid in a confined space, and the force is distributed to perform work.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <strong>Pressure</strong> in a hydraulic system is typically measured in pascals (Pa) or bar. <strong>Force</strong> is calculated using the equation: <em>F = P Ã— A</em>, where:
          <ul className="list-inside list-disc mt-2">
            <li><strong>F</strong> is the force</li>
            <li><strong>P</strong> is the pressure</li>
            <li><strong>A</strong> is the area of the piston or surface where the pressure is applied</li>
          </ul>

        <ul className="list-inside list-decimal text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Hydraulic Fluid</strong>: The fluid used to transmit power in the system, usually oil or water.</li>
          <li><strong>Reservoir</strong>: Where the hydraulic fluid is stored and filtered.</li>
          <li><strong>Pump</strong>: Converts mechanical energy into hydraulic energy.</li>
          <li><strong>Actuators</strong>: Hydraulic cylinders or motors that convert hydraulic pressure into motion.</li>
          <li><strong>Valves</strong>: Control the flow, pressure, and direction of the fluid.</li>
          <li><strong>Hydraulic Lines</strong>: Pipes or hoses that carry fluid between components.</li>
          <li><strong>Filters</strong>: Remove contaminants from the fluid.</li>
          <li><strong>Accumulator</strong>: Stores energy in the form of compressed fluid for later use.</li>

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Hydraulic systems are used in a variety of industries due to their ability to produce large amounts of force efficiently. Some common applications include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-inside list-disc text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <li><strong>Construction Equipment</strong>: Hydraulic systems control the arms, buckets, and booms of machinery like excavators and bulldozers.</li>
          <li><strong>Automotive</strong>: Used in car brakes, power steering, and jacks.</li>
          <li><strong>Aerospace</strong>: Controls flight surfaces and landing gear on aircraft.</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacturing</strong>: Hydraulic presses used for metal forming and molding.</li>
          <li><strong>Marine</strong>: Used for steering, propulsion, and lifting in ships and submarines.</li>
          <li><strong>Agriculture</strong>: Tractors and farming equipment use hydraulic systems for tasks like plowing and lifting.</li>
        </ul>

          Some common issues in hydraulic systems include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-inside list-disc text-gray-700 mt-4">
          <li><strong>Leaks</strong>: Can cause a loss of pressure and reduce efficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>Overheating</strong>: Fluid can become damaged if the system overheats.</li>
          <li><strong>Contamination</strong>: Contaminants in the fluid can cause wear and damage to components.</li>
